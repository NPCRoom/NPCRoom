Project bootstrapped with Vite.

This is the front-end for NPCRoom, built using Vite and TypeScript.
Vite is a build tool that helps create React or Vue projects (it is made by the same people who made Vue.js, another front end framework).

If you are running this locally:
npm install (might need: npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion styled again)
npm run dev
